# Recipe Master â€“ Recipe Catalog System #

Recipe database is an essential tool that allows users to quickly access, manage, and organize recipes, breaking them down into simple steps and components. 
The "Recipe Master" project addresses the problem of how to efficiently store, structure, and access recipe information in a clear and user-friendly way, breaking it down into steps and ingredients.

### System Purpose ###

The system aims to create a convenient and interactive platform where users can upload, view, and manage recipes. Each recipe will be broken down into steps, with each step containing the necessary ingredients. This system will help users organize their recipes and make cooking easier.

### Functional Requirements ###

1. Users can create new recipes, input the title, description, add steps, and for each step, list the required ingredients.
2. Users can edit and delete existing recipes.
3. Each recipe must be divided into steps, with each step having its own list of ingredients.
4. Users can browse, filter, and search for recipes by title or ingredients.
